- **Added:**
  Rocq can be compile-time configured to be relocatable,
  using `./configure -relocatable` instead of e.g. `./configure -prefix /some/path`.
  See :ref:`system_config` for an explanation of how Rocq uses its configured installation paths
  (`#19901 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/19901>`_,
  by GaÃ«tan Gilbert).
