- **Fixed:**
  Ltac2 in terms in notations is more aware of the notation variables it uses,
  providing early failure when the variable is instantiated with an invalid term,
  preventing a spurious warning when a variable that cannot be instantiated is unused,
  and preventing exponential blowups from copying unused data
